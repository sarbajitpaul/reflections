What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When I initialize a repository, git automatically creates a hidden directory
    named '.git' which contains meta data about the repository. 
    We need to initialize a directory so that git can start tracking it and treat
    it like a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area denotes the area where all the changes made would be bundled
    up into a commit. Working directory is just the place where we do our stuff.
    It offers more flexibility.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
