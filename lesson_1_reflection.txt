How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was easily able to pinpoint the lines where the changes that were made 
    introduced the bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I would be more confident on making larger changes than making small 
    iterative ones.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Keeping the power in your own hands is all than everyone needs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Since in a code based project, multiple files can be dependent on one 
    another thereby making it essential to make changes to more than one file at
    the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First use git log and then use git diff on the commit IDs that we obtained
    from the output of git log.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It's more convenient to make larger changes now that I'm using version 
    control to track my files.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For developing websites mainly.
